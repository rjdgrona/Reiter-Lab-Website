info: Mia is interested in understanding how primary cilia signal. To date, there have been 33 G-Protein Coupled Receptors that localize specifically to the primary ciliary membrane, and not the rest of the cell. We have yet to understand the rules behind this specific localization. Mia is interested in how these GPCRs localize to the cilium, what signaling pathways they affect in the cilium, and how these contribute to overall organismal health in the body.
