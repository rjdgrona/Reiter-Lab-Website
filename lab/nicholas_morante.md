info: I’m interested in ciliary signaling and proteomics. The primary cilium is as specialized signaling organelle, yet the full array of pathways which are fed through the cilium, as well as how protein diversity varies from tissue to tissue, is currently only partially explored. Examining the protein composition and signaling components in cilia provides a snapshot of the spectacular diversity of the primary cilium in vertebrates.
